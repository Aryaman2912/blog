        <title>An intuition on how RNN and LSTM works</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-intuition-on-how-recurrent-neural-networks-and-lstm-works&quot;&gt;An intuition on how Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM works&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let us first try to understand how RNNs work and how they are used to solve sequence modeling tasks that require the model to store the information seen before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;working-of-rnn&quot;&gt;Working of RNN&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;At time step 0, RNN takes the input X&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, predicts an output h&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and stores the information in the state S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Now, for the next time step, the RNN takes the current input X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; along with the information from the previous state S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and predicts the output h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; subsequently storing the information from the previous state...</description>

        <title>How are researchers and their research rated?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of research is continuously happening around us. While the word research seems fascinating to most of us, we seldom know how impactful the research is or how the actual impact of any research is measured. While there are many techniques for adjudging researchers, journals, and research papers, none is absolute.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are four main ways that google scholar uses to rate a researcher. These are papers, citations, h-index, and i-10 index. Papers mean the number of research papers published by a researcher. More number of papers would mean a higher volume of research. Citations are the number of...</description>

It's is a Python-based scientific computing package targeted to be a: (1) A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs and (2) A deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed. It's developed as an open source project by the Facebook AI Research team, and is being adopted by teams everywhere in industry and academia and...</description>

        <title>An Introduction to Minimax Algorithm</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;an-introduction-to-minimax-algorithm&quot;&gt;An Introduction to Minimax Algorithm&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ever wondered how a computer is able to play wisely in games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess and Go? It all boils down to the ever-evolving Artificial Intelligence (AI). Now, what if I say that building powerful AI for such games is easy? Yes, you read it right. We can design powerful AI that can play games much better than you, me or pretty much everyone. As a first step towards this, I would like to introduce you guys to a pretty simple, yet essential algorithm for this task - &lt;strong&gt;Minimax Algorithm&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-minimax-algorithm&quot;&gt;What is Minimax...</description>

It was designed to stay above the surface of water like a hovercraft but travel at far greater speeds like that of a commercial aeroplane. This was achieved with the help of an air cushion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hovercrafts have downward facing fans which generate the necessary lift while Ekranoplans used its wings and built up speed to...</description>

        <title>Communication Protocols Part 1</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consider a multiplayer game that involves two or more participants. As there are many multiplayer games on an online platform, there’s always a need to be a proper collaboration between the players. A game is only as good as its rules, and how well we play the game is defined by how well we follow the rules. Often, players ignore these “protocols” and end up messing the system with no result and just chaos. From this, you may guess these “protocols” are not just a necessity in games, but most of the aspects of life. Users (which include...</description>

        <title>A Dive into Git Directory</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Git is a distributed version control system. It means Git helps you manage different versions of your work, record the changes and helps different collaborators work parallelly on the same project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Imagine that you are working on a big project involving many files and folders in it. You make a series of changes to your project and now finally when you compile it, you see the application is crashing or not working as expected. In such a case, Git is the best tool you could use. If you have recorded all your changes uniformly in Git, you can any time...</description>

Every genome contains all the data required to create and maintain that organism.&lt;/em&gt; In humans, a replica of the whole genome (more than three billion DNA base pairs) is contained in all cells that have a nucleus. Modification to provide desired traits in plants, animals, and microbes used for food began around 10,000 years ago. These changes, in conjunction with natural evolutionary changes, have resulted in common food species that are currently genetically totally different from their ancestors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/Genome-Editing/figure1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Genome Editing&quot;...</description>

Scroll down to find out!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For most beginners, the title itself might be a bit complicated to digest. So let’s split it into its 2 major components - &lt;strong&gt;Neural Networks&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Power Systems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-neural-networks&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are Neural Networks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled after the human brain, primarily designed to recognize patterns.
